<title>CirclePack  'disp' commands</title></head>

<body><center><h1><big>Structure of <em style="color:blue">CirclePack</em> 
display commands</big></h1></center>
<p>
      The ability to display circles and other geometric objects in
      canvases is central to the power of <b style="color:blue"><em>CirclePack</em></b>. 
      Display actions are carried out using the <b>disp</b> command
      (short for <b>display</b>). Here are two examples, the first
      illustrating an elementary call of the type available via right-mouse actions in
      canvases. The second illustrates more sophisticated actions which are available 
      in command lines and scripts.
</p>
<center><big><b>disp -w -c</b>
</big></center><br>
<center><big><b>disp -w -cf a(1 10) -df b -gt5c40</b>
</big></center>
<p>
	The commands <b>disp</b> and 
	<b>Disp</b> apply to the active packing's canvas or to a specified canvas 
	(using the <b>-p{.}</b> flag).
	(Note that using the capital <b>D</b> makes the command 
	persistent, so it will be reapplied whenever that canvas is redrawn.) 
</p>
<p>
    In this document we describe the display command structures available to the user. 
    There are three components: First is the command <b>disp</b>; 
    then an optional <b>-p{n}</b> to indicate the packing to which the command applies; 
    and finally a sequence of one or more "flag segments". The real action is in these 
    flag segments.
</p>    
  <center><h2>Flag Segment Structure</h2></center>

	The more complicated display command shown above has four flag 
	segments, as grouped here:
<p>
	 <center><big><b>disp
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    -w&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    -cf a(1 10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    -df b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-gt5c40</b>
</big></center>
</p>
	We will describe each as illustrative of general construction principles. 
	Each flag begins with a dash '<b>-</b>' followed by a letter indicating the action 
	or the object type. 
<ul>
<li> <b>-w </b>: this wipes the canvas clean.</li>
<li> <b> -cf a(1 10)</b>:
	the <b>c</b> indicates the objects are circles and attribute <b>f</b> means circles 
	filled with their recorded colors. The list of which circles to draw is given 
	next: in this case <b>a(1 10)</b> indicates all circles with indices from <b>1</b> 
	to <b>10</b>, inclusive.</li>
<li> <b>-df b </b>: 
	The <b>d</b> indicates dual objects and in this case the <b>df</b> indicates 
	dual faces. (If there were a further <b>f</b>, that would indicate to draw them 
	as filled.) The <b>b</b> gives the list of dual face indices, namely "boundary" 
	dual faces in this case.</li>
<li><b>-gt5c40</b>: 
	The <b>g</b> tells <b style="color:blue"><em>CirclePack</em></b> to draw its currently 
	stored closed path. The <b>t</b> is a thickness attribute, setting to <b>5</b> in 
	this case, and <b>c</b> is a color attribute, color code <b>40</b> (light blue) 
	in this case.</li>
</ul>

	The specifications of lists used here are examples of the huge range available, 
	as described in the <b style="color:blue">List Specs</b> tab in the 
	<b style="color:blue">Help</b> window.
	For details on the many objects which can be displayed and their structures, 
	look for <b>disp</b> in the 
	<b style="color:blue">Command Details</b> tab in the 
	<b style="color:blue">Help</b> window.

  <center><h2>Attribute Encoding</h2></center>
<p>
	The display attributes of an object follow the letter for the object with no
	intervening spaces. They are specified with letters, and perhaps digits.  
	An <b>f</b> specifying a "filled" object must immediately follow the object letter, 
	but other attribute	can be included in any order. After this first string of 
	letters in a flag segment, any remaining characters specify "data" for that
	flag segment, namely, the list of targets that call is applied 
	to --- circles, faces, edges, etc.	In many cases, the default (an empty data 
	string) is taken to mean "all". Thus, <b>disp -w -c</b> will 
	wipe the canvas and display all circles,
	while <b>disp -w -c b</b> will wipe the canvas but then display only the
	boundary circles. (See the <b style="color:blue">List Specs</b> tab in the 
	<b style="color:blue">Help</b> window.)
</p>
<p>
We illustrate attributes with some typical examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	<b>-cffg</b> and <b>-cfbg</b>:
	circles filled with foreground <b>fg</b> or background <b>bg</b> color. 
	Typically, these are dark grey and white, respectively.
</li>
<li>
	<b>-ccbg</b>: this displays circles with the background
	color; essentially this can make the circle disappear.
</li> 
<li>
	<b>-cfc5</b>: filled circles with color <b>5</b> (dark blue)
</li> 
<li>
	<b>-cc5t8</b>: circles with color <b>5</b> and thickness <b>8</b>. Thickness
	can range from <b>0</b> (minimal) to <b>15</b>.
</li>
<li>
	<b>-t2ft3</b>: "trinket" of type <b>2</b> (a triangle) positioned at the
	center of a circle, filled with the color of that circle. The <b>t3</b> determines the 
	thickness (actually size); this grows rapidly, in this case the base size times <b>8</b> 
	(<b>2</b> to the power <b>3</b>).
</li>	
	</ul>
	
  <center><h2>Some Final Notes</h2></center>

The drawing actions specified by the flag segments of a display command
are carried out in order first to last, and that order can make a difference 
in outcome, as later drawing can obscure early drawing, depending on a 
canvas's 'transparency' settings. 
	
<ul>
<li>
	Recall that <b>Disp</b> creates a persistent display 
	command; until superseded, redrawing of a canvas (as when it is moved by 
	the mouse) will	reuse the specification. Persistent display commands can 
	also we recalled or specified in the canvas's 
	<b style="color:blue">Screen -> Display Options</b> menu.
	
</li>
<li>
	The command <b>disp</b> (with no flags) or 
	<b>disp -wr</b> will wipe the canvas and redraw using
	the current persistent display command. 
</li>
<li>
	Colors use codes <b>0</b> (background) to <b>255</b>. Codes <b>1</b> to <b>200</b> 
	are a spread from dark blue
	to dark red, with <b>100</b> being white. Those from <b>201</b> to <b>255</b> are a 
	mixture of additional
	colors, with those from <b>232</b> to <b>248</b> being a nicely separated spread.
</li>
<li>
	Objects for packing <b>p</b> can be displayed on the screen of packing <b>q</b>. 
	This is an example: <b>disp -p1 -q2 -f</b>.
</li>
<li>
	The <b>post</b> command for generating PostScript images of the canvases is
	parallel to the <b>disp</b> command in nearly all features.
</li>	
</ul>
