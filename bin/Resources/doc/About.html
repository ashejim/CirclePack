This is "CirclePack", software for creation, manipulation, analysis,
and display of circle packings. If you want to know more about this
topic see

Note that <em><font color="blue">CirclePack</font></em> is primarily
a experimental research platform, so it is continually a "beta" version.
Knowing the topic is of wider interest, I have tried to make the
interface somewhat user friendly, in particular through "scripts" 
available on the <em><font color="blue">CirclePack</font></em> web site.
For bug reports or comments, email me at <em>kens@math.utk.edu</em>.
<br>
<br>
The software is written in Java, version 1.6 or higher. Heavy 
computations can make use a shared library of C++ routines, if that
is available.

I wish to acknowledge the many people who have helped with development 
of this program over several years (with my apologies to anyone I might
have overlooked): Thanks to the National Science Foundation for support
of my research. My work with students has resulted in many program 
features: Tomasz Dubejko, G. (Brock) Williams, Woodrow Johnston, Jason 
Howard, James Ashe, and Gerald Orick. For special help with Java and 
C++ programming, Ben Pack and Sam Reynolds.
