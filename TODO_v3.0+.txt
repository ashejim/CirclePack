This is a new TODO list started with version 3.0, promulgated when I moved
to GitHub early in 2020.

See TODO_old for earlier TODO's (most still awaiting attention).

Many of these tasks and others are labeled as "TODO" in comments
in the Java code itself.

* Convert uses of double[3] to Point3D, especially in sph computations.

* Complete separation of 'EdgeSimple' (for edges <v,w>) and 'GraphSimple' (for dual edges <f,g>)

* Start whole MCV (model-controller-view) conversion: This may be good place to use modules.

* 'TriAspect' is trying to play too many roles: simplify by creating some derived classes.

* as of 7/2020, getting errors I can't trace which seem to relate to 'HoverFrame's. 
  I'm currently trying to disable them by stopping mouse actions.
  
* Add "clear" / "reset numbering" buttons to screen shots window, reformat layout

* Add screen shot directory to configuration options 

* spanning tree needs work for multiply connected cases.

* should allow negative euclidean radii for reverse oriented circle and be able to
  draw with fill on the outside.
  
* Should rethink whole redchain business, perhaps reformulate using 'TriAspects'.

* Compute side-pairing Mobius transformations in spherical case.
  Probably first set up parallel structure and debug it before throwing out current.
  
 
* ==================================  major =========================================
*
* Three major structural changes are needed: MCV, standalone, and DCEL 
  How to do these? while keeping CirclePack running? Which first? Should I also 
  consider java modules? Can I possibly make it backward compatible so existing
  scripts work?
  
  August 2020:
  + Start with DCEL transition (since I want to use that with Schwarzians).
    * Link in usual PackData, e.g. KData, RData, 
    * Keep changes simple --- modify things, then go back and rebuild the DCEL
    * adjust routines to see if DCEL is available and increasingly try to use it.
    
    
* Need some new conventions for 'flower' or 'bouquet' since in the DCEL structure
  a vertex can be repeated in different 'bdryFan's. 
  We might convert to "POLYGONS" instead of "FLOWERS" as CirclePack's main
  organizing principle. Big change!
