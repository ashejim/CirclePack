These are things to work on for release of CirclePack java version ???:

* When variable is defined, old value needs to be deleted first: e.g., old slider.

* 'gen_mark -c b' reports on faces instead of vertices, (though the result may be a vertex)

* Also, need to update "Variables" panel.

* At Oberwolfach, someone described color vertex shader behavior and in particular
  a weight scheme due to Shephard. Something about wi_bar = 1/norm(p-si)^alpha where
  alpha is in [1, infty]. Then wi=wi_bar/sum(wj_bar). Recall, I want to attach color
  r, g, b to each vert so it predominates as you approach that vert.

* add flags to 'screenbump' to set "Dir" and "Base Name" elements for jpg
  nameing, location.
  
* 'SetBuilderParse': Bracket builder notation should allow tiles as objects --- this 
  means changing the current boolean (circles vs faces) to a bit encoded integer.

* Tiling: When writing tiling with augmented edges, check that edges still seem valid, e.g.
  compare to nodeCount and throw out all augVerts in case of any failure.
  
* Tiling: When reading, see if the augVerts are already there; may figure out way to use them. 

* For "extended" edge specification should have 'es v u w' options, which means
  to go from v to u and then extend "straight" (i.e., pass through symmmetrically
  on interior, stop for verts on boundary or odd degree) until reaching w,
  within usual number of steps.
  
* When swapping indices, have to go through all the tilings if tiledata exists;
  careful, only the original tiles themselves are available outside the 
  'ConformalTiling' pack extender.

* Need way to adjust numbering in screen images.

* 'create tri_group 6 5 5 2' works differently than 'create tri_group 6 2 5 5',
  the latter being the correct outcome. Why the difference? Should we always
  order the a b c by size? 

* Future possibilities for migration: GraphML is widely accepted XML format for 
  graphs. Netbeans has nice GUI builder. "dcel" structure for cell decompositions;
  "doubly connected edge list" structure is efficient. "cgal" algorithms for 
  line arrangements.
  
* Need way to save the dual cell decomposition to a file as a tiling.

* Language option: #(....) applies computation to stuff inside, eg. r:=#(sin(Pi)).
  call function routines to parse the stuff in the parentheses; in fact, 
  variable substitution should apply since that's done in advance, as
  with r:=#(sin(_theta)). Move to jep3.0 from singularsys.com, maybe ditch
  Jim Rolf's stuff.
  
* in "adjoin" command call, saving of overlaps is done before calling
  'adjoin' routine. Why not put that inside the adjoin routine itself?
  
* Need 'ScriptLibrary' repository.

* hover "AboutImages" in the browser are handled with a separate
  thread, and that leads to them appearing too late. Is there a
  way for the tread to check if mouse is still in browser window?
  
* Should be able to specify default www page on startup: could put 
  all your links, scripts, etc. to keep track of experimental
  themes.
  
* Should www browser have an edit option?

* On startup CPFlipper.jnlp doesn't show the tools on the left
  of the active canvas.
  
* Create routines to represent circles in the Lorentz space form.
  E.g., so we can apply Mobius transformations to them. 
  
* In the 'create' command, those methods that generate based on
  tilings should generate the 'tile' data information (though I
  don't recall right now what that is: see 'ConformalTiling'.)
    
* Regularize layouts in tabs of "Save" frame, get rid of Jigloo stuff.

* Info Panel issues:
  * 'mark' does not show up in Info panel for vertices.
  * 'Choose edge' isn't showing
  * 'desired edgelength' isn't shown.
  * many unedited spots should still allow the cursor to show for scanning
  * ?vert doesn't do anything.
  * Should have "side pair" section showing corners, colors, pairings, etc.

* Popup of images in www frame needs another check to make sure mouse
  is still in the window. See 'PreviewImageHyperlinkListener'; need to
  pass the window, perhaps, and check that before viewing. Problem: it
  is running in another thread.

* Need "browse" button for finding Tag image in script header editing.

* what happened to the "scale_rad" command? is it part of some other 
  command? 

* may want to use new 'zlist' 'Zlink' lists of points in place of old
  methods for paths.

* catch up/down arrow to increase/decrease radii.

* need new code to read FLOWERS: for tiling in 'readPack'. The petals are
  vertex indices (not tile indices), so after reading in, have to process
  to build the flowers of the vertices before calling 'barycentric' to
  create the packing.
  
* script menus are 'boxmenu's, set to edit or show; created in, e.g.,
'cmdActionPopup' in 'CmdSBox.java'.

* 'radius_col_ramp' needs to be fixed to take account of horocycles (??)
  
* Need a "refine" command with various options: hex, bary, quad, pent,
  twisted pent. Also, perhaps a "tile_refine", where a 'tile' is
  the flower of some vertex; tiles would have to be indicated by
  some marking. 
  
* CirclePack should have a "hidden" packing, a place to stash something
  you want to save --- e.g. to have a circle you can draw on one of the
  canvasses.
  
* need 'set_grid' option that uses current path and/or path in Function window.
  e.g., can use this in ErfRefine.xmd.
  
* When script is in + mode (commands displayed) and you open a
  section, its commands are not open.
  
* Why does 'gen_mark' message talk about the last "face" instead 
  of vertex?
  
* strange effect when error interrupted script read: the title
  appears (perhaps more than once) on top of the script stack,
  even after another script is laoded or a new script requested.
  Something needs to be cleared out.
  
* can I watch for a double click on a Pair screen and use that to make
  it active? I've watched for double clicks in the small screens. (There
  I should add that double click to the pack name area, as well.)
  
* In script writing, add an original date in addition to a last update date.

* could sometimes use hidden initialization of variables when a script is
  read in. That way the variable can be reset and the '*' start icon can
  be invoked without moving it back to the original.
  
* 'print' should have a "save to file" option; perhaps default to that if
  there is no printer.
  
* Need better feedback when 'cookie' fails: e.g., alpha too close.
  
* When new file, AboutImage, or data is added to the CPdata section, the
  indication that the file is modified should be updated.

* When removing data file, need to redraw File section

* When saving a file to script, be sure to say that script needs saving.

* 'max_pack' a closed genus 2 surface should do the right thing (namely, just 'repack').

* see "// TODO: Alex, how do I "; I want to save directory as 'scriptDirectory'
  if it is a file (versus the net) and not 'new_script'
   
* Need new 'rmsg' for "running messages", messages issued by methods
  as they run: make it green in the history.
     
* When loading from chooser, should set directory so save goes back to
  same directory.
    
* In list specifications, use '~' for logical "not". E.g., disp -c ~m,
  to draw the circles which are not marked.
  
* Need to be able to read general locally planar graphs that are not
  triangulations. Should read flowers in as usual, then identify faces
  that are not triangles and add bary centers.

* New problem (related, perhaps to others involving menus): In bringing
  up menu on thumbnail in screen frame, often accidentally print an
  earlier image. Seems that some mouse click or move has been waiting for
  completion and the user accidentally triggers it. 
 
* Not painting border of choosebox green when loading script (successfully) from web.

* Change formatting of examples in CmdDetails.html: table format isn't 
  working.

* Experiment Sandbox: For intensive experiments, I should have a separate
  sandbox where things run and don't get in the way of the rest of CirclePack.

* Clever technique we might use with variable frame: hover over a number,
  get a slider to come up, adjust it.
  
* Might have a "Map" feature that shows graphs (based on circle packings
  of course) directing users through various scripts. It could be saved
  in a parent script, would pop up when needed, and clicking on a topic-labelled
  circle, would bring up that script.
  
* mnemonic is misbehaving on icons when editing the script --- latest letter
  occurs rather than the appropriate one.

* Is path given when packing is loaded from "Load" button? Or if read fails.

* Fix the history, so the issued command comes first. What's the problem?
  timing issues? Work on this thread, which may be causing lockup in Windows.
  
* Font issues:
  * "Commands:" font gets cut off (sometimes). Do we have to put some fonts in jar?
  * Titles of scripts are too large.
  * tool exponent character is poor looking.

* Need "temp" vlist, elist, flist that lives only during a given
  sequence of commands.
  
* When a script read failed, seemed to get locked out of trying
  another read.

* Message window isn't updated when CirclePack first starts. Should have
  one message at beginning if 'HeavyC' is not available. 

* Check meaning, consistency, dependability of 'Face.rwbFlag'. Want to 
  use it in non-simply connected cases to set actual vertex locations. 

* Try to position windows: see 'getRect', called from 'setViewRect'.
  Currently only called when positioning next command

* Frank Martin suggest command line argument when starting CirclePack
  that prevents drawing -- e.g., doesn't open the canvasses. Need a
  command line version. Creating it would help separate GUI from core
  functions.
  
* Need better control of directories: e.g., when writing .q files it 
  should change directory when dialog is used. 
  
* 'delaunay' (and other commands) with no arguments should default to 
  bring up a dialog to load a file.
  
* need command to go with '-f', '-s', and '-a' when writing to a socket
  (or external program, such as matlab).
  
* Write specified list with '-l' or '-L' command: default to vertices,
  faces, and edges, but, e.g., '-le' would just do 'elist' while
  '-Le' would do 'Elist'.
  
* Would like to put ';' in 'output' files, cut semi-colons are caught by
  my parser as command separation symbol. Maybe can do presearch for
  'output', then hold it aside somehow and keep any ';'s that appear.
  
* When reading data files, should always search for and ignore # comment lines.

* When data file is removed in editing a script, need to repopulate cpdata 
  section to remove its icon.
  
* Build a cmd feedback 'packet', replacing what now goes to 'history',
  so it will be more flexible.
  
* Build 'socket' command with flags for server/cleint (replace 'start_socket').
  Need to give it 'host' and 'port' in client case. Should set up protocol so
  every socket is given a name and they are put in a list. 
  
* Need to close, monitor sockets, open socket for outgoing, etc.

* Should deprecate "add_edge" and make it "split_edge".

* Should have a 'ping' command to show CirclePack is running, e.g. on a socket.

* I used the GUI builder 'Jigloo' at one time: the only places it
  seems to remain are: OutPanel.java and WritePackPanel.java. It
  probably should be removed from these as well.

* Consider allowing circles of radius 0 (in all geometries): what
  are the implications? may need to modify layout procedures, e.g., to
  avoid degenerate face, may need to prevent contiguous zero radii,
  may have to adjust "aim", set negative?? etc. Is setting to small
  positive OKERR, preferrable?

* Now that I see 'split_vert' in action, it could subsume or augment
  some other calls: add_bary, split_edge, add_cir, add_face.
  Might be more efficient to call it --- less code to maintain.
  Need system to save overlaps, if they exist.
  
* "merge_verts" is not done. Also, seems to be problem with 'split_vert' on bdry.

* In 'split_vert' (whenever we add a new vert), have to check that we
  allocate overlaps (if overlapstatus). Check that all things are set:
  'plot_flag', bdryflag, etc. 

* Need NSpole option which maps one circle to the outside of unit
  disc so the others can be projected to hyperbolic geometry.
  ?? could we geom_to_e and then scale?

* No message when reading a packing in.

* Drag/Drop packing file in data section into a packing.

* Really need a "movie" making option; cross-platform is the issue.
  On unix, use 'convert -delay 50 -loop 0 cpShot*.jpg crane_emulation2.gif'

* Writing to script via the "save" dialog box should not use a chooser;
  put in a text area.
 
* 64-bit library problems: here's what libHeavyC seems to want: Also need
  the 64-bit dll's.

 markov:~/workspace/CirclePack/JavaCode/cdeps/libs> ldd libHeavyC_lib-x86_64.so 
        linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fffb91ff000)

* Frames like "Screen" should come up closer to button so they aren't
  covered if you stray into main window.
  
* finish method 'split_vert' in PackData, which was only started; also make
  it reversible, to merge verts.

* norm_scale doesn't normalize the stored redchain center into.

* I don't think we can display redchain on sphere, though data may be available
  in redchain (when converted, that info is converted as well).

* Problem with 'PackExtender's being attached to packings: can't
  easily swap the packing. Need to consider alternatives. 
    * Maybe just save the pack extenders to the new replacement packing ---
  	  that could screw some things up.
  	* Maybe the Extender should be attached to CPDrawing instead?
  	* Need a listener to know when packextender is out of sync?

* computing "area" was giving an error in DateTree updating.

* In "Info" frame, add angles to face data; improve layout for edge data

* Open/close the last icon in line box, and its closed (compact) version
  doesn't go back into a new line box --- some parent isn't being redislayed.
  
* loading user tools, failed to find icon, didn't use default.

* in LineSBox of command icons, the embellishments are getting cut off (on Ayres desktop).

* need at least a limited "undo" command: perhaps save (for one execution round) small
packings in backup, light up a "undo" button if appropriate.

* F2 does not, as it claims, lock the floating windows.

* ?? Move 'VertScriptBar' to right side of MainFrame??

* for tooltext with file icons, add type: e.g., packing, raw, etc.

* does 'puncture' only do one at a time?

* 'appending' data to script files is a mess. Need some standard structure,
  since one must find the file, remove it from the script, append, add back
  to script --- this after iterating through writing --- all with error
  checks, e.g., default to writing file.

* In BrooksQuad, H doesn't seem to change with the 'toggle'

* fix hoverH.png

* Fix pairedframe: a little smaller on set_displ -m, repaint after change.

* Report canvas sizes after 'set_displ'

* extend number of hex-extended edges allowed.

* after disp -g, the color seems to be left in 'blue' mode; try
  displaying a grid before and after disp -g.
  
* Fix description of 'set_grid' to say how it handles hyp case.

* Get file to load with www button, so I can use it and link the scripts.

* Build a print command for scripts: should convert to html and
  print command section expanded and list the data included (unexpanded). 
  
* Want Owl Icon (large) for when jar is on the desktop.

* Need to prevent script from moving over pairwindows whenever icon
  is clicked.

* Can I actually put in higher resolution icons and scale them for a
  better look?
  
* In drag/drop, how does one change the temporary icon used for hovering
  on drop target?
  
* Create toolbar "scroll" class, with arrows at end to scroll through
  longer listings of tools.
  
* Strange problem: canvas drawing popup gets flaky. When you use it
  near the edge, it's okay.  
    
* Have always needed "PackListener" feature, so code can be notified
  of relevant changed in the packing combinatorics, etc. So, for
  example, if an extender is started but the a flip is executed, then
  maybe some data becomes invalid. Should catch this and recompute.

* fix icon naming, searching. Need search strategy, then store only
  name itself, no path. Icon names screwed up in Sass scripts: have
  "script/<name>" instead of just "<name>".
  
* Might have "<JPG>" and "<PNG>" (or <IMAGE>) data type and allow 
  images to be displayed on separate screen or on canvas (?).
  Might also be able to designate one as a thumbnail that will
  appear in directories, web pages, etc.  

* Would be nice to have a "conditional" statement for scripts: if
  condition doesn't hold, don't do the rest of the line, or set some
  variable.
  
* Orick's hyp max routine should be changed to (upon request)
  the current euclidean radii as starting radii. Then one can
  hope to refine a partially computed packing.
  
* Pack extenders seem to get lost or disconnected when 'swapPackData'
is called. (e.g. see necklace stuff)

* Consider spanning trees as standard layout method. Would like to 
  refine them to get better "spiral" layout sequence.
  
* make graph, dual graph, tree code more general.

* disp -dff colors dual faces, but also boundary regions out to boundary 
vertices. Why?

* disp -De or -Df or -Dv would (for non-simply connected) call 'buildDualGraph'
  and then recompute data as drawing progressed.
  
* The script history of files should not have tmp names: when loading
  from the web, that URL is what should be saved. see 'loadNamedScript'
  and 'getScript': will have to pass new argument giving the url name.
  
* Flesh out the "Display Commands" help file, make a test script

* make graph, dual graph, tree code more general.

* add new '-dt' and '-dw' dual 'trinket' and 'triangle' commands
  to the 'post' command.

* Should have "sorting" options: return linked list of [v,f,e]
  sorted by criterion [.] (e.g., degree, radius, area, etc.)
  in in/decreasing order.  

* Cleanse should clear Vlist, Flist, Elist, ... others? ---

* To try to improve display speed, how about drawing directly to 
  an appropriate canvas? Problems: I draw to packings not currently
  displayed; I put transient axes on the image; I need to copy the
  image to pair canvases, thumbnails, jpg's, etc. I also have to
  figure out when it's necessary to catch the paintcomponent calls
  so I don't repeat unnecessarily. 
  
* In RationalMap, want to improve slitting process to avoid
  combinatorial geodesic that come too close. Need to mark
  'puffy' region around the segments as they are cut so that
  new geodesics segments will stay away.

* Should we be able to compute injectivity radius for surfaces 
  using the side pairings? It will be the minimal distance between
  points identified by a covering group, but that may be hard.
  
* Test 'PackData.cir_closest' and perhaps make cir_search call it.

* Need many more drag/drop prescriptions:
  * drag tool to different location.
  * drop command tool or text into location in script.
  * drag tool from "scratch" script into script and vice verse.
  * drag box to position in script.

* I don't seem to have my display flags (color, thickness) set up for
  all calls. e.g., 'layout_facelist'. Should check every call so it
  can include these options.
 
* CMD_REORG marks places that command thread reorganization has to be
  adjusted -- when I figure out the thread/timing issues.
   * GUI and house cleaning actions --- careful of changing active pack, 
        script, extenders. Commands already being processed should have
        their packData fixed.
   * active pack may need to be frozen when calling background processes
   * Background --- long term (e.g., calling C code), separate thread,
         may need separate progress indicator (with 'p'?)
   * 'for' and 'delay' loops --- want spinning owl, but be careful of
         self-reference. 
   * All this processing seems to be causing delays. Need lightweight
     method to look for "for"/"FOR", etc.      
   * routine actions, spinning owl, but block until done 
   
* should be able to color code for qc in harmonic examples.

* Fix 'in thread' error messages to pass along more information

* on Windows, search for script started in 'temp'. Didn't I set the
home directory? or does it need a 'scripts' subdirectory?

* Missing as of 7/2010:
  * resizing main canvas
  * lousy "Cursor" button functionality
  * poor "Cursor" button placement
  * why do scripts load poorly from chooser/combobox 
  * Script window scrolling: not positioned after edits
  * drag/drop "tool" icons
  * New Mobius panels
  * Info panels needs: list display/edit, more info on faces 
    (e.g., which circle it locates), more info on circles 
    (e.g., mark)
  * Commands return values to set variables
  * Better reporting of messages/errors. (Some messages are
    not being created, others are lost or not added to 
    command history.)

* in 'CommandStrParser', is 'memory_flag' of any use now?

* good syntax: X:=?vert M, sets variable X to the value of the largest
index. Can reestablish old "?.." style info commands for printing
(default) or setting variables.

* Need to fix C++ code calls to avoid, eg., some global variables,
as in 'triangulation', by sending data back in a more standard way.

* in runCP.jar, 'post' is sending images to the "temp" directory set
up for libraries. Seems that working directory is set to temp.

* Seems that the -oi -oa options for 'post' are not operational.
  What gives? I vaguely recall something about inability to open file at
  specified location in Java.
    
* Have to test 'build_j_function' routine.

* Barrett ideas:
  (1) Suggestion by Crane for branch parameter: branch circle broken
      into two (or more) of different sizes.
  (2) For trees, find "middle" (unique vert or edge) so two halves
      have same diameter. Triangulate to get (perhaps) nice distribution
      of ends.
  (3) How to start jar with script: don't I have a jarbomb style?
  (4) More combinatorial options (Crane. Not sure what he meant)
  (5) Use Brooks parameter (a la Brock) to modify qc dilatation.
      For each edge, could set parameter to modify that quad
      interstice: t=0 or t=infty should be one edge or edge flip.
  (6) Saw some crashes on apple. Maybe due to history writing snag.
  (7) Start a user group or wiki page.
  (8) include in Sage.
  
* Need way to tell command to await return from Library calls: e.g., when
creating a random packing, processing must await return. Maybe a flag check?

* map canvasses not repainting with changes (sometimes)

* need more colors in color -c d (degree coding)

* Problems in 'WeldManager'. One common problem is copying new pack data
into one of pack[i].packData. Need to set hes, set name for thumbnail
titlebar.

* Extender icons in small canvasses added multiple times.

* Fix axes locations for different screen sizes.

* Allow *.png, *.gif output?

* Regarding drawing ops: 'imageContextReal' is set with creation of 'CPDrawing's,
and points to 'packImage' (a 'BufferedImage').
Where are paint operations?
  + 'MainFrame.reDisplay'
  + 'CPDrawing.paintComponent'
  + 'ActiveWrapper.paintComponent'
  + 'PairWrapper.paintComponent'
Where is 'packImage' referred to?
  + 'CPDrawing.getThumbnailImage'
  + 'ImagePanel.storeCPImage'
  + 'PostPanel.canvas2JPG' call
look for key word 'GRAPHICS' to see the major changes

* When screensize too small, need to adjust where windows pop open --
  sometimes they're totally out of view.

* In browser, should have special icon for *.xmd and *.p, *.q files.

* Need something that keeps drawing operations from getting interrupted,
  some command (Java has something) that watches until it's complete.

* Put option for using reverse Beltrami coefficient --- invert the
  affine map.

* Turn "list" info file into html.

* Should be able to provide "function" via a file hook, so better
  descriptions can be supplied.

* when saving script, name (if new) should be added to 
  load window and address history. (Also, may want to
  catch /tmp/new_script.xmd and NOT add to history.)

* Need a generic "histogram" call that pops up histogram window
  for generic read data and can be iconified somewhere.

* Add popup, non interactive, canvas for things like "harmonic"
  function (result of h+gbar). Should be able to screen dump it.

* Why doesn't "extender" icon get updated on small canvas label?

* I no longer have any way to read/manipulate lists of
  verts/edges/faces. Need "list" command?? add to "info" panel?

* reorganize packing "data"

* Info panel doesn't show 'mark' or 'plotflag', edge desired length,
  Also, geometry is not in "info" panel.

* Windows problem: directories/names can have spaces. May need to
  require '-f' flag for all {filename} instances in commands. (Will
  be hard to find all and change syntax.)

* 'plotFlag' can be inconsistent; e.g., can affect 'cir_search'
  results. When can 'plotFlag' fail to be set? Is this mechanism
  needed any longer?

* loading new script removes its cursors from list, but doesn't
  return to default cursor.

* Tailor scrolling of message, scratch, history windows. If
  slider is not at bottom (i.e., to watch some particular line),
  then should stay; otherwise, should shift to show new line.

* continuing problems with max_packing on the sphere: 
  * 'puncture' choice is conflicted. Sometimes, antipodal points are
    not good choice.
  * Orick's C code punctures face instead of circle; need better options
    for choice of face.
    
* Need to integrate C packages (with Orick's consent); get rid of some printf's
  used for debugging.    	

* Building MyTools, should add option for custom cursor. (Should it
  be just on active pack? or on pairMap packs, too?)

* read a spherical packing in and the first image doesn't have
  the unit sphere drawn.

* finish putting in 'textSizeSlider' stuff.

* Auxiliary frames get too easily hidden when mouse enters 
  active frame; can they go on top?

* When using dialog to save a packing, it doesn't disappear
  after the save.

* Need tailored "package" approach to get CirclePack going in
  select modes:
	* want options for what menubar items should appear:
		script? output? loading? printing?

* occasional error in dropping "next" icon. Hm??

* could allow drag/drop to copy one packing into another.	

* icon choosers are getting several copies of the same icon.	

* "Paginate" has not been implemented.

* The "exec" command hasn't been implemented yet.

* does "extender" actually implement F1-F10 keys, as Help says?

* For various "cursor" uses, need more variety of icons in list.

* Have to put the color/thickness options in "post" as in "disp".

* repaints are still a problem: e.g., after 'enclose 0 v',
  the edge is drawn, but doesn't show up.
  
* in 'PackExtender', need simpler way for user to specify
  lists of vertices, edges, or faces, in the commands whose
  parsing they write themselves.

* Redo the tool Edit window to look more like the script 
  CmdSBox edit window.

* Fix help files on the new color codes 'compactDispFlag'
options.

* Get better mouse behavior on popup menus: namely, second
hit should get rid of menu.

* need temporary 'vlist', 'elist', 'flist' that only last
as long as the current string of commands. Want to use, but
not to destroy either local or global lists. Have I done
this already?

* More informative error messages: e.g., 'set_fill_opacity' range
problems.

* make "Messages" button glow or pulse when a message arrives?

* graphics idea:
  - log4j  logging tool
  - may want to dispose of graphics2D objects
  - use component.createImage to get buffer for imaging.
  - java.awt.Area call to do intersections.
  
* find option for writing the sectors inside of faces. In AffineStruct perhaps?

* If .packrc not found, pop up message on where's it's looking and
  how/where user can create file.
   
* Add "tangency point" to edge data, add |z| to vertex data
  in packinfo tab, add "mark" to vertex data
  
* When opening Mobius tool frame, need to select appropriate tab:
  SO(3), disc, or general?
  
* Note: CPDrawing.mobius is not currently use.

* call to 'set_mobius' should put the result in the "general" mobius
  vector (where is that?) and put icon out in "mobius" window.
  
* complete 'postPoly' 'postColorPoly' etc routines for other geometries.

* 'postPath' calls not ready for spherical geometry.

* redo 'output' tab: add scrollbar'd text area showing what you're
  file looks like (and letting you add manually).
  Might add functionality: e.g. "abs(VZ)" would automatically
  be parsed to give absolute values of the centers.
  
* 'GlobalListPanel' isn't working to update text from CP;
  other functions probably not working either.

* Get "standalone" package, e.g., so Elias can have matlab call
for repacking.

* "random_tri..". Fix help file and parser terminology.

* need new filefinder paradigm: .circlepack directory??

* Finish 'PathInterpolator' for array-defined paths.

* Clicking mouse once in small canvas of active pack should make
the active window come to the top if hidden or iconified (and
not in map-window mode).
  (window manager seems to get in the way)

* Need mechanism for setting and processing variable names. E.g., 
set "X" to 'nodeCount' and then do 'disp -c X' to display it.
Should use '_X' type notation to indicate that something is a variable
in, eg., 'NodeLink' parsing. Several other things will eventually
be needed:
	+ classes for parsing real/complex number fields
	+ class for maintaining, displaying, setting variables
	+ local/global dichotomy

* Add split in "screendumps" panel so thumbnails of postscript
images can be shown. (Note: can't always use screendump; e.g.,
if you want to put parts of different packings in the same image.
But need conversion software.)

* might incorporate 'Imagemagic' calls for processing images
(eg making animations). Windows version is a problem

* Implement map "connection" behavior; add to "Map" command. 

* Fix standardize 'footprint' computations that determine how many
division to use in drawing arcs.

* Make variable 'pack[]' into 'PackData' instead of 'CPDrawing'; i.e., 
flip roles of PackData and CPDrawing, making the former more central.
** Related: split out code to make libraries less interconnected, 
easier to use in separate packages.

* "Beep" is not working right; never in linux, always in windows.

* 'About' should show my book jacket and information

* need "center" option for 'set_screen' (euclidean case)

* formulae needed: 
	* incircle data for spherical triangles
	* mutually orthogonal circle to triple (all geometries)
	
* want to set 'screenshot' basename in JTextField from the 
script (like 'set_disp_text')

* For 'PackExtenders' (like Brooks, RiemHilbert, etc.) might not only
have an icon attached to the canvas, but have an optional command
line.

* ??? flow layout not working for screen shot tab.

* pack names not appearing correctly in small screens

* Should have "self-registering" pack extenders --- don't have to
change anything, just have new class. User would give command like
'extender {name abbrev, blah..blah}', giving abbreviation and 
(somehow) the class name, then commands '|abbrev| ...' would be
fed to the extender

* Switch to Jim Rolf's parser stuff; use it for parameterized paths 
as well --- maybe other uses?? derivatives 

* Color ramp should be handled with new 'Color' creation routine;
use non-linear eye response to set up scaling method.

* Need a PackExtender for laying out equilateral faces via
'words', that is, by [0,1],[1,infty],[infty,0] edges encoded
in words. Need way to color code edges, for example, and ways
to follow two different commbinatorics as one time, a la the
function pairs idea Sass is working on. (Is 'WordWalker' a start?)

* Find how to execute, eg., popup ghostview (see Jeremy email, 9/07)

* Have -R {s..} option in FaceLink for "sides" of red chain: e.g. -R a
  or -R 2 5  or -Rm 1 4 (-Rm for mated sides, so this is for the mates
  to 1 and 4.). Also an option for NodeLink? EdgeLink?

* 'write' command should end in "[-a -as -s] <filename> " structure;
get rid of 'A' append option. Also, get rid of 'f' option for plot
flags and use 'f' for faces (listed as triples of vertices.

* Fill colors are too bright in postscript: should wash them out to look 
more like the live canvas (even though there's no transparency)

* Finish reading all readpack data types, all "infile_" read types.

* Fix post -oa, -oi so we can open files for new data: trouble with RandomAccessFile.

* Should have a method for doing Marshall's zipper code within CirclePack.
Maybe a "packExtender"

* check repack: seems that we're 'reaping radii' perhaps more often than
needed; do we need to store data there, or is it still in place when we
restart the computation?

* "Screen" settings (opacity, etc) aren't being reset on reads and
  on changes such as 'setFillOpacity' in CPDrawing

* In 'string_tokenizer', there should be a 'complexvalue' type
and routines for identifying and reading an input string as a
complex (in various possible forms).

* Need better list manipulations operations: union (without
repetition) of lists, intersections of lists, complement of
one list in another, prune list of repeats, reorder list, etc.

* Might have a new feature: as reader goes through script, 
options are presented in a popup window (and generally default
is defined). E.g., a window pops up and says "draw a closed
curve with the path icon -- or accept default". 

* Icon lists should be automatically generated (use all *.png's
or all??) so user can add icons.

* Screenshots should show thumbnail of postscript saves.

* fix tool editor: no 'Mnemonic', drop icon, if named add '[.]' to
tool tip.

* When cmdSBox is in edit mode, repaints can wipe out temporary
entries (like name); need temporary storage to prevent this.

* in windows (some?) menu items disappear when greyed out.

* need to catch arithmetic errors, especially in Mobius maps and
illegal radii.

* Arrange to draw 'polygon's on sphere sphere (but always keep
data as complex pts; infinity just has to be a very large value.)

* redo "tree" packing data storage format (what is standard? start index 0?)

* Arrange consistent name updating for packings: when read in, when
copied, override file info, etc. (e.g., see 'setPackName' in C code)

* put in automatic timed save of script for backup.

* put elements in 'Sections' by D&D'ing icon.

* get "selected" feature (i.e., on active window menuitems) to work.

* Improve formatting of script output: how to put in tabs, linebreaks?
