<h1> Welcome to <em><bf>CirclePack</bf></em></h1>
<em>CirclePack</em> is mathematical software for experimenting with configurations of circles having prescribed patterns of tangency. The home for circle packing, <a href="http://circlepack.com">circlepack.com</a>, and an <a href="http://forum.circlepack.com">open forum</a> are still under construction. Meanwhile, you might visit my <a href="http://www.math.utk.edu/~kens/CirclePack/scripts">homepage</a>. <p>
</br>

<em>CirclePack</em> operates mainly through "scripts". Click <a href="http://www.math.utk.edu/~kens/CirclePack/scripts/Basics/Menagerie.xmd">Menagerie</a> as an example. The script will appear in the "Script" window; you can click through using "NEXT" for a quick tour. <p>
</br>

I created and maintain <em>CirclePack</em> for purposes of my own mathematical research, so it is always a "beta" version and subject to change. However, to better share this fascinating topic, I have tried to make <em>CirclePack</em> as user-friendly, capable, and stable as possible. I enjoy hearing about related mathematical questions, about applications or potential applications, and about the
software. Feel free to join the <a href="http://forum.circlepack.com">open forum</a> (just being initiated) or contact me directly. <em>Enjoy!</em><p>
